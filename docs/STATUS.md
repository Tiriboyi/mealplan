# Project status

## Where we are
PR #2 (`typography-instrument-satoshi`) holds pre-devrailsv2 work, now covered by RFC-2026-003 (Satoshi from Fontshare, font file removed for licence reasons) and RFC-2026-004 (SQLite promotions cache recorded and tested, ADR-0002). Both are implemented on `rfc/2026-004-record-the-sqlite-promotions-cache`, which is stacked on the RFC-2026-003 branch.

## In flight
- RFC-2026-002 (next 16.4.2) and RFC-2026-001 (weekly budget): done on their own branches, to be rebased onto PR #2 after it merges.

## Next step
Fast-forward `typography-instrument-satoshi` to `rfc/2026-004-record-the-sqlite-promotions-cache` and push PR #2. Note that PR #2 pins `next@16.4.0`, which Next refuses to build, until RFC-2026-002 lands. Open decisions for the requester: purge the font from git history (force-push), the Fontshare privacy question, and accepting ADR-0001/0002.
